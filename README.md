Simple project animating a Dartmouth student

I wanted to try my hand at C# scripting and 2D skeletal rigging using Unity over Winterim break. It was an enjoyable process for sure and I'd love to try out 3D and AR/VR projects in the future. 

To look at the project, git clone this repository and run it onMacOS. To play the game, simply launch FirstGame.app.

To look into the code, go into the Assets folder. Once you open it in Unity, go to Scenes -> Gameplay.unity. 

In the assets folder, you will find the following folders: 

CollegeStudent: The animations and sprites (skeletal rig) that I used to create the character

Scenes: Gameplay.unity

Scripts: All the code for scripting the game

Sprites: The background images
